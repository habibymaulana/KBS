## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework. You can also check out [Laravel Learn](https://laravel.com/learn), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains thousands of video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

## Project License & Hosting Recommendation

- **License:** This repository includes a project `LICENSE` (MIT) with an attribution note: this project was developed as a class assignment **rj23c Kelompok KBS**. Please retain the attribution when reusing the code.

- **Recommended hosting for the full application:** Render (https://render.com). Render supports PHP web services and managed databases and integrates directly with GitHub for automatic deploys.

Quick deploy checklist for Render:

1. Create a Render account and connect GitHub.
2. On Render, create a new **Web Service**, select this repository and branch `main`, and choose the PHP environment.
3. Add environment variables in Render's dashboard (`APP_ENV`, `APP_KEY`, `DB_CONNECTION`, `DB_HOST`, `DB_DATABASE`, `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD`, etc.).
4. Provision a managed database (Postgres/MySQL) on Render and update DB_* variables.
5. Run migrations and seeders (via Render's console or a one-time deploy command): `php artisan migrate --force` and `php artisan db:seed --force`.
6. (Optional) Configure a custom domain and HTTPS in Render.

If you prefer a container deployment, consider Fly.io or Railway and add a `Dockerfile` to the repository.

If you want, I can: create a GitHub Actions workflow to automate builds or prepare a `render.yaml` for Render. I have added a starter `render.yaml` in the repository to help you create a Render service quickly.

Using the included `render.yaml`:

- Connect your GitHub account to Render and add this repository.
- When creating a new service on Render, choose "Use render.yaml" so Render will use the file to create the web service and a managed database automatically.
- After service creation, add necessary environment variables in Render (see checklist earlier), then trigger a deploy.
